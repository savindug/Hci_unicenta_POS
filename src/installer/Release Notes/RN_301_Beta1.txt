uniCenta oPOS v3.01Beta1
Date: 4th September 2012 @ 07:00

uniCenta oPOS ships with the Apache Derby Embedded (default) database for a single, local installation. 
The database is installed, by default, in the C:\Documents and Settings\yourprofilename\unicentaopos-database directory.
uniCenta oPOS also supports multiple Point Of Sale terminals across a network. 
In this case you will need to install a multi-user database such Derby Network Client\Server version, MySQL, Postgres or Oracle - (see uniCenta oPOS Installation and Administrator manuals).
These databases must be properly running and configured without issues before installing uniCenta oPOS. uniCenta oPOS can be easily configured to connect to an alternative database at a later stage.

Known Issues
1. Upgrading from previous versions is not yet complete. You wil receive an error message
2. Employee Presence Management requires MySQL DB at this release. You will errors if using default Derby Embedded DB
3. Icons - Work In Progress. Poor contrast with lighter Look and Feel themes. Change to a darker theme i.e.; Magellan or Twighlight

*** SOURCE CODE WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL AFTER uniCenta oPOS v3 IS RELEASED FROM BETA ***
