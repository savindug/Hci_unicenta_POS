Release: v3.80Beta

********* KNOWN ISSUES *********
1.  There is a known issue with HSQLDB 2.+ JDBC driver which does not handle BLOB
    (Categories, Products, Customers, People) correctly
    It causes an error when loading Sales panel - Clicking OK allows you to
    continue seemingly with no adverse effect
    Adding Images to (Categories, Products, Customers, People) forms is affected.
Suggestion: avoid use of HSQLDB database or revert to older 1.8 driver
