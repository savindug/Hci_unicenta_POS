uniCenta oPOS ships with the Apache Derby Embedded (default) database for a single, local installation. 
The database is installed, by default, in the C:\Documents and Settings\yourprofilename\unicentaopos-database directory.
uniCenta oPOS also supports multiple Point Of Sale terminals across a network. In this case you will need to install a multi-user database such Derby Network Client\Server version, MySQL, Postgres or Oracle - (see uniCenta oPOS Installation and Administrator manuals).
These databases must be properly running and configured without issues before installing uniCenta oPOS. However, uniCenta oPOS can be easily configured to connect to an alternative database at a later stage.
