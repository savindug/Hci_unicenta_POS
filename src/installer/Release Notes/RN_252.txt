Known Issues: Windows 7:

System Defaults:
Not picking up System Defaults from Operating System OS in Configuration file options
Resolution/Work-around: Delete - unicentaopos.properties

Changes in Configuration parameters when in Main application sometimes generates Error Message that it Cannot be Saved.
This is due to persistent Windows 7 file locking whilst main uniCenta oPOS application is open.
Resolution: After Install.  Run uniCenta oPOS Configuration option (configure.bat) from Windows Start>Programs menu before starting main application.
Make all subsequent changes using only uniCenta oPOS Configuration option (configure.bat) from Windows Start>Programs menu

Reports:
Save Report to Microsoft Excel Single or Multi-sheet file does not create an .xls output file.
This is due to a Jasper report driver error.
Resolution: Save file as .CSV and open using Microsoft Excel
